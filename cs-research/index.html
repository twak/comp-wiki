<strong>Managing PhDs</strong> at Leeds Computing
<p>
<ul>
 	<li>There is a course you should take (<a href="https://uolr3.leeds.ac.uk/temcatsearch(bD1lbiZjPTUwMA==)/courses.htm?sap-params=Z2Rfa2V5d29yZHM9RWZmZWN0aXZlJTIwcG9zdGdyYWR1YXRlJTIwU3VwZXJ2aXNpb24mZ2Rfc3R5cGU9JmdkX3R1dG9yPUxhc3QlMjBuYW1lJmRhdGUxPWRkJTJmbW0lMmZ5eXl5JmRhdGUyPWRkJTJmbW0lMmZ5eXl5JmRhdGUxPTAwLjAwLjAwMDAmZGF0ZTI9MDAuMDAuMDAwMCZwcm92aWRlcmxpc3Q9MCZhbmRvcj1BTkQmc29ydD1CRUdEQSZnZF9jYWxsaWQ9SU5JVElBTCZzdHlsZT0%3d">Effective Postgraduate Research Supervision)</a> before supervising students. This was vague enough for all faculties (e.g.  humanities my only supervise PhDs once a month), so contained very little read information, I finally got a link to the university regs out of the supervisors.</li>
 	<li>There is another course to be an internal examiner (<a href="https://uolr3.leeds.ac.uk/temcatsearch(bD1lbiZjPTUwMA==)/courses.htm?sap-params=Z2Rfa2V5d29yZHM9VGhlJTIwUm9sZSUyMG9mJTIwdGhlJTIwSW50ZXJuYWwlMjBFeGFtaW5lciZnZF9zdHlwZT0mZ2RfdHV0b3I9TGFzdCUyMG5hbWUmZGF0ZTE9ZGQlMmZtbSUyZnl5eXkmZGF0ZTI9ZGQlMmZtbSUyZnl5eXkmZGF0ZTE9MDAuMDAuMDAwMCZkYXRlMj0wMC4wMC4wMDAwJnByb3ZpZGVybGlzdD0wJmFuZG9yPUFORCZzb3J0PUJFR0RBJmdkX2NhbGxpZD1JTklUSUFMJnN0eWxlPQ%3d%3d">The Role of the Internal Examiner</a>).</li>
 	<li>You should record PhD progress (i.e. once a month) in <a href="https://research.leeds.ac.uk/">GRAD</a>. GRAD will email you every time any action is taken on any student you are connected with - add an email filter and forget about it!</li>
 	<li>The "<a href="https://minerva.leeds.ac.uk/webapps/portal/frameset.jsp?tab_id=_2_1&amp;url=%2Fwebapps%2Fblackboard%2Fexecute%2Flauncher%3Ftype%3DCourse%26id%3D502596_1%26url%3D">Engineering &amp; Physical Sciences (EPS) Graduate School</a>" minerva organisation has <a href="https://minerva.leeds.ac.uk/webapps/blackboard/content/listContent.jsp?course_id=_502596_1&amp;content_id=_6268904_1&amp;mode=reset">GRAD resources</a>, <a href="https://minerva.leeds.ac.uk/webapps/blackboard/execute/displayLearningUnit?course_id=_502596_1&amp;content_id=_7050831_1">additional course details</a> (e.g. technical English), and a PhD student <a href="https://minerva.leeds.ac.uk/webapps/blackboard/execute/displayLearningUnit?course_id=_502596_1&amp;content_id=_7042917_1">assessment roadmap</a>.</li>

<strong>Grants</strong>. <a href="https://ris.leeds.ac.uk/applying-for-funding/">Uni grant-writing-overview.</a> For a financial details for a grant, <a href="feng-research@lists.leeds.ac.uk">email faculty research</a>. They also like to know the outcome. I suspect we are also meant to tell <a href="https://eps.leeds.ac.uk/computing/staff/76/professor-anthony-g-cohn-freng-ceng-citp">Tony</a> about past/present/future grants.

 <p>
  <ul>
 <li><b><a href="http://je-s.rcuk.ac.uk/">JeS</a></b>. The grant applciation portal for EPSRC + a bunch of other research councils. It will automatically send your grant to the School's research team upon submission (without asking permission).</li>
 <li>The <a href="https://epsrc.ukri.org/funding/applicationprocess/routes/newac/nia/">new investigator award</a> was my first contact with the world of grant-writing.</li>
 <li>There is no library of grant examples, I ended up trying to write a grant having only seen one - a big mistake. Email the school's research leads (Tony+Karim) and <a href="mailto:fepsapps@leeds.ac.uk">faculty research office</a> begging for examples.</li>
 <li>OPDL occasionally has courses for grant-writing (search <a href="https://uolr3.leeds.ac.uk/temcatsearch(bD1lbiZjPTUwMA==)/initial.htm">here for "grant"</a>), but not frequent (and clashes with teaching). </li>
 <li>Library has no few on grant writing. <a href="http://smile.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B00GLS6VOY/">I bought this (old) one - not EPSRC specific</a> - post-covid financial panic, I'm sure the school will buy these for you</li>
 <li><a href="mailto:fepsapps@leeds.ac.uk">FEPs grant application team</a> will be able to populate your JeS proposals with funding requestions. You can add the team member in charge of your application to your application to let them enter the (arcane) financial stuff, but they will also make small changes (re-submit etc...) without asking permission:</li>

  <b>REF</b>. Research excellence framework / five yearly excercise from UK govenment. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research_Excellence_Framework">Wikipeida</a> has the best overview :/. No real motivation to engage with this (all star-ratings are anonymous). Determines the baseline research funding from central government (4 star paper is worth about £100k to school. Staff just have to write mysterious "100 words" for their publications <a href="https://web.microsoftstream.com/video/6df4c122-5f3c-4762-8103-d1d611c238b0">(Tony's video)</a>.

  <a href="https://iris.leeds.ac.uk/">IRIS</a> allows you to annotate research outputs for REF:</li>
 <ul>
 	<li>This is populated autoamtically from Symplectic</li>
 	<li>You can nominate your 4 papers for REF on the "Outputs Review -&gt;Nominate Output column -&gt; check box next to the ones you want to nominate"</li>
 	<li>Through some undisclosed procedure, the nominated outputs are assessed externally. This can be found by clicking "Outputs Review (purple), -&gt; scrolling down -&gt; and clicking the tiny '+' to show the review and assessed REF classification (green)" (Click image to embiggen):</li>
