For semester 2 the assessment preparation deadline for all levels is 1200 on the 28th of February. This year, due to a request from external examiners, we will be required to provide the external examiners with all examinations and coursework (where the module is assessed by coursework only or forms a substantive component of assessment) for assessment.

Prior to the deadline

<ul type="disc">
 	<li>The exam papers should be internally assessed (list of assessors can be found <a title="https://sis.engineering.leeds.ac.uk/live/comp/ts/module.cgi?cmd=liststaff&amp;year=2019" href="https://sis.engineering.leeds.ac.uk/live/comp/ts/module.cgi?cmd=liststaff&amp;year=2019" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-auth="NotApplicable">here</a>).</li>
 	<li>The assessment preparation form should be signed by the module leader and assessor and submitted to the SSO (<a id="OWAfa826aff-d6e4-8fe3-6c40-9ef92dab7f31" class="x_OWAAutoLink" title="https://leeds365.sharepoint.com/sites/SchoolOfComputing/SETS/tadmin/SitePages/Home.aspx" href="https://leeds365.sharepoint.com/sites/SchoolOfComputing/SETS/tadmin/SitePages/Home.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-auth="NotApplicable">Assessment  preparation form</a>).</li>
 	<li>The exam paper and mark scheme should be uploaded to the SIS exams repository (<a title="https://sis.engineering.leeds.ac.uk/live/comp/ts/exp.cgi?year=2019" href="https://sis.engineering.leeds.ac.uk/live/comp/ts/exp.cgi?year=2019" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-auth="NotApplicable">Exam repository link</a>).</li>
</ul>
<div><span style="font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;"> </span></div>
<div>

The templates for examinations have changed. The new templates can be found <a id="OWA8e7ddb49-69b4-6dba-eea4-20325daa8283" class="x_OWAAutoLink" title="https://leeds365.sharepoint.com/sites/SchoolOfComputing/SETS/tadmin/SitePages/Home.aspx" href="https://leeds365.sharepoint.com/sites/SchoolOfComputing/SETS/tadmin/SitePages/Home.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-auth="NotApplicable">here</a>. Please do not use any old templates you may have. For coursework only modules please complete the assessment preparation form as you would for an examination and also upload the coursework specification of the substantive coursework and mark scheme to SIS.

For those modules that also run in SWJTU, this semester, we will not require a separate examination paper. The examination periods coincide so we can use the same paper both here in Leeds and in SWJTU. This, however, does require you to ensure that the paper set is suitable for use both in Leeds and SWJTU. I would ask that you liaise with your module co-leader to ensure suitability of the examination paper.
