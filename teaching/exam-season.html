   <strong>exams.</strong>
   <ul>      
      <li>there is a <a href="">catalogue</a> of previous exams. Point the students to this.</li>
      <li>exams are prepared in advanced and signed off by assessor and external. (But external feedback never arrives in time)</li>
      <li>the management make a lot of noise about exam grading deadlines, but everyone is overworked and everyone submits them late.</li>
      <li>Students who fail your module have to resit the following august (<40% fails years 1-3, < 50% fails MSc modules)</li>
      <li>Resit period is ~last 2 wks in August. But it isn't documented anywhere - wait for the emails. Resit materials have to go through the external and assessor</li>
   </ul>

<ul>
 	<li>You'll get an email 2-3 days after exam to collect the scripts from the SSO. Picture is what 240 scripts look like... So make sure exam is easy to mark, and you have a clear run of a few weeks to dedicate to exam marking.</li>
 
 	<li>Mark exams in red ink. Write mark for each question in margin and circle. Fill in table on front of paper.
<ul>
 	<li>Report grades per question (Q1, Q2, Q3) (<em>not</em> overall; <em>not</em> per sub question (Q1a, Q1b)).</li>
 	<li>Enter grades in SIS (see below, and <a href="https://vcg.leeds.ac.uk/school-of-computing-wiki/teaching/minerva/">hints on minerva to SIS wrangling</a>)</li>
 	<li>There is a notional 5 day deadline to do this, but I took 2 weeks for my big course (~50 scripts a day for me once I got going).</li>
</ul>
</li>
 	<li>Then, scripts go to module assessors to assess 10% in green ink.</li>
 	<li>Then scripts + other paperwork (as below) goes to SSO. This includes:
<ul>
 	<li>the marked scripts</li>
 	<li>a sample of marked coursework - 10% of the cohort</li>
 	<li>examination paper and marking scheme</li>
 	<li>coursework specification/brief and marking scheme</li>
 	<li>a module report form signed by the module leader and internal assessor (available from the <a id="OWAcf1e5f1e-7fb8-184c-511f-916ea1f2dea8" href="https://leeds365.sharepoint.com/:w:/s/SchoolOfComputing/SETS/tadmin/ETvJDhdJ7NNOoseqA9XZAjMBfNLQ1ESt994UKVRhs2wAMA" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-auth="NotApplicable">Teaching SharePoint site</a>)</li>
</ul>
</li>
 	<li>Script mark check people use purple ink on all.
<ul>
 	<li>They just check for math errors (or if you forgot to circle a grade in the margin).</li>
 	<li>You will get back forms with list of errors from SSO</li>
 	<li>You should then update SIS again &amp; complete forms.</li>
</ul>

<strong>Email from Natasha, March 2019:</strong>

If you get an email from the SSO about CW exemption for a particular student, please enter * in SIS.

When you finalise semester 2 results in June, do not do any manual recalculations or grade adjustment for students with exemptions.

<b><u>On the examination day</u></b>

</div>
<div>

On the day of your examination the School expects that you are available to answer any queries that may arise regarding the examination paper.  You are expected to attend the first 10 minutes of your examination. Please also leave your contact details with the invigilators in the examination venue. If for some reason you are unable to attend the start of your exam or you will not be reachable during the examination please come and speak to me or Mark Walkley so we can arrange alternative cover.

<b><u>Marking examinations</u></b>

</div>
<div>

Examinations will be available for collection from the SSO. The office will email you and let you know when they are ready for collection. Marking of examinations should be completed in red pen only. It is the responsibility of the module leader to enter the grades into SIS carefully considering the following cases before finalising the results:

</div>
<div>


<b><i>Examination marks</i></b>

</div>
<div>
<ul type="disc">
 	<li>Students who did not attend the examination should be marked as 'AB' [tom says: this goes in the final grade (cw+exam) column "Hand Edited Grade
HE" - the system remembers the CW grades as well]  (for coursework only modules 'AB' should be recorded if the student did not submit any coursework).</li>
 	<li>Students who have a module mark of 39 should be carefully considered and hand edited to either 38 or 40 (a note should be included on the module report form).</li>
</ul>
<div>

<b><i>Coursework marks</i></b>

</div>
<div>
<ul type="disc">
 	<li>Where a student has not submitted a piece of coursework '-' should be marked against that component.</li>
 	<li>Where a student has had an exemption from a piece of coursework '*' should be marked against that component.</li>
</ul>
<div><span style="color: black; font-family: Calibri,sans-serif;"> </span></div>
</div>
</div>
<div>

<p>
Once the grades are finalised the module leader is responsible for submitting the following paperwork to the Student Support Office:
</p>

</div>
<div>
<ul type="disc">
 	<li>the marked scripts</li>
 	<li>a sample of marked coursework - 10% of the cohort</li>
 	<li>examination paper and marking scheme</li>
 	<li>coursework specification/brief and marking scheme</li>
 	<li>a module report form signed by the module leader and internal assessor (available from the<a id="OWAcf1e5f1e-7fb8-184c-511f-916ea1f2dea8" href="https://leeds365.sharepoint.com/:w:/s/SchoolOfComputing/SETS/tadmin/ETvJDhdJ7NNOoseqA9XZAjMBfNLQ1ESt994UKVRhs2wAMA" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-auth="NotApplicable">Teaching SharePoint site</a>)</li>
</ul>
<div></div>
</div>
<div>

The School asks that all the relevant paperwork is submitted to the SSO <b>within 5 days </b>of the examination papers being ready for collection from the SSO. If you feel that you will be unable to meet this deadline then please discuss with me or Mark Walkley.
