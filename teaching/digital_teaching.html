<b>Digital teaching resources</b>
</p>
  
<p>
  <b><a href="minerva.html">Minerva</a></b>. Leeds' teaching system - the student's first contact with the module module. Can be used to email students, return grades...
</p>
  
<p>
<a href="https://mymedia.leeds.ac.uk/Mediasite/MyMediasite">Lectures <strong>Video Recording</strong> Mediasite</a>: live lectures are recorded onto this automatically. Here you can edit, (un)publish, download and manage the lecture video recordings. Lectures are recorded by default, you will be emailed a link after your lecture (to make it accessible click the padlock icon), otherwise they become accessible to your students after 72 hours (<a href="https://leeds.service-now.com/it?id=kb_article&amp;number=KB0011801">change this behaviour</a>). 
  <ul>
    <li>It is possible (but not easy) to <a href="https://leeds.service-now.com/it?id=kb_article&amp;sysparm_article=KB0012106">download</a> the videos. </li>
    <li>Doesn't work behind GFW/China.</li>
    <li>Doesn't accept some video files, such as the default output by OBS.</li>
  </ul>
</p>

  <p> <b>Collaborate Ultra</b> has <a href="https://www.leeds.ac.uk/vle/staff/collab/collaborate/">never worked well</a> for me. Students complained about bitrates for live streams. Sending slides down the video channel (which works well in every other streaming system) produced very poor results - required some custom slide setup which barfed when exposed to lots of video. Poor integration with desktop and China. Avoid if possible.
  </p>
  
<p>
  <a href=""><b>OBS</b></a> Opensource software which allows you to combine multiple video source (powerpoint, video, screen capture, multiple cameras) and stream at the same time as recording (i.e. to upload to MS Stream).
  <ul>
    <li>The <a href="https://obsproject.com/forum/resources/obs-virtualcam.949/">virtual cam</a> addon allows you to add a virtual webcam to you pc - so Zoom/Teams can see the OBS output</li>
    <li>I have to transcode the video saved by OBS before it would be accepted by Mediasite. IT aware and dismissed (INC0414157).
      <pre>
      ffmpeg -i "2020-09-28 08-57-35.mkv" -vcodec h264_nvenc out.mp4
      </pre>
    </li>
  </ul>
</p>
  
<p>
  <b> <a href="https://web.microsoftstream.com/">MS Streams</a></b>. (sign in with UoL account). A streaming platform which works better than Mediasite, but without all the nice integration with lecture-theatre cameras. Faster upload/encoding/captions etc... Good integration with MS Teams.
 </p>  
  
<p>
  The omnipresent <b>MS Teams</b> works as advertised, but becomes difficult with our class sizes. 
  <ul>
    <li>Computing sets up teams for first and second year tutorials, as well as all taught modules. You can use these lists to controll access to MS Stream groups and channels</li>
    <li>Add a big obvious link from your Minerva module to Teams channel if it is your chosen discussion channel.</li>
    <li>I ended up using links to <a href="https://universityofleeds.zoom.us/">Zoom chats</a> to run tutorials so that I could avoid calling 400 students from the main module channel. Had to switch between Zoom (didn't work in India) and Teams (didn't always work into China) to talk to people in different countries.</li>
    <li>Having 400 students try to PM you is untenable. The "module chat" degraded into noise because Teams re-orders posts based on last-edited thread (so it is hard-to-impossible to ensure all questions are answered. Interface will jump whenver a new post is made (even if you are in the middle of replying to an earlier one). </li>
    <li>During Covid the school used Teams as both a phone service and student communication channel. This failed when all staff stopped leaving Team-on-by-default because they were swamped by undergrads.</li>
    <li>Integrates well with MS Stream and Forms.</li>
    <li>Next year I will try <a href="https://leeds.service-now.com/it?id=kb_article&sysparm_article=KB0012999">Yammer</a> for teaching. This will hobble the social-interaction side, but will make dealing with student numbers manageable</li>
  </ul>
</p>

<p>
<b>Zoom</b> is available for staff <a href="https://universityofleeds.zoom.us/">here</a>. Click sign-in. I used this to run tutorials to avoid calling the entire MS Teams channel.
