<a href="https://mymedia.leeds.ac.uk/Mediasite/MyMediasite">Lectures <strong>Video Recording</strong> Mediasite</a>: live lectures are recorded onto this automatically. Here you can edit, (un)publish, download and manage the lecture video recordings. Lectures are recorded by default, you will be emailed a link after your lecture (to make it accessible click the padlock icon), otherwise they become accessible to your students after 72 hours (<a href="https://leeds.service-now.com/it?id=kb_article&amp;number=KB0011801">change this behaviour</a>). 
  <ul>
    <li>It is possible (but not easy) to <a href="https://leeds.service-now.com/it?id=kb_article&amp;sysparm_article=KB0012106">download</a> the videos. </li>
    <li>Doesn't work behind GFW/China.</li>
    <li>Doesn't accept some video files, such as the default output by OBS.</li>
  </ul>
</p>

<p>
  <a href=""><b>OBS</b></a> Opensource software which allows you to combine multiple video source (powerpoint, video, screen capture, multiple cameras) and stream at the same time as recording (i.e. to upload to MS Stream).
  <ul>
    <li>The <a href="https://obsproject.com/forum/resources/obs-virtualcam.949/">virtual cam</a> addon allows you to add a virtual webcam to you pc - so Zoom/Teams can see the OBS output</li>
    <li>I have to transcode the video saved by OBS before it would be accepted by Mediasite. IT aware and dismissed (INC0414157).
      <pre>
      ffmpeg -i "2020-09-28 08-57-35.mkv" -vcodec h264_nvenc out.mp4

    </li>
  </ul>

<p>
  <b> <a href="https://web.microsoftstream.com/">MS Streams</a></b>. (sign in with UoL account). A streaming platform which works better than Mediasite, but without all the nice integration with lecture-theatre cameras. Faster upload/encoding/captions etc... Good integration with MS Teams.
 </p>  
  
<p>
<b>Zoom</b> is available for staff <a href="https://universityofleeds.zoom.us/">here</a>. Click sign-in. I used this to run tutorials to avoid calling the entire MS Teams channel.
</p>

<p>
<b>MS Teams</b> is the default tool for running classrooms during Covid. I've had issues scaling (with 300 students the ever-reordering conversations becomes problematic. In computing there is a teams channel for each module.
