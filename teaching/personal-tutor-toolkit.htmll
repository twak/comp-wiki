(from an email by Jessica Christie in 2019. Mark confirms that we should meet with all our first year students together once a week, not 3x year as follows).
</p>

&nbsp;

Please find attached a Personal Tutor Toolkit that summarises the role of the Personal Tutor and provides some key information for signposting tutees.

&nbsp;

Below is an example structure of the kind of topics you may discuss with your tutees. Meetings are expected to take place 3 times in the academic year for level 1 undergraduates and taught postgraduate students and at least twice a year for levels 2-4. These may be programmed in your electronic staff timetable but if not you could check with your DSE or your SES team <a href="mailto:sso@comp.leeds.ac.uk">sso@comp.leeds.ac.uk</a>  as to which week personal tutorials take place in your school.

If you require a reminder of how to find out who your Personal Tutees are you could check this with your SES team at <a href="mailto:sso@comp.leeds.ac.uk">sso@comp.leeds.ac.uk</a> They should also have highlighted to you if you have any tutees that are under 18, have a disability or require any other specific support.

&nbsp;

You can also follow <a href="https://ses.leeds.ac.uk/info/21800/student_support/836/personal_tutoring">A link to further guidance for signposting students and further resources for Personal Tutors</a> for further advice for directing students for further support.

&nbsp;

We will also send you an invitation to our next training session when this has been arranged.
