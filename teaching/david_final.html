<div>Dear all,</div>
<div></div>
<div>If you have any UG final year projects to assess, please do so AS A MATTER OF URGENCY as we need to finalise the marks before the exam board, else the students will not be able to graduate in July.</div>
<div></div>
<div>This includes late submissions up to and including May 22nd.</div>
<div></div>
<div>Please complete by early-mid of next week (10th-12th June) using the instructions below.</div>
<div></div>
<div>Regards,</div>
<div></div>
<div></div>
<div></div>
<div>
<div>Prior to meeting with the supervisor/assessor:</div>
<div></div>
<div>1. Prepare your Individual Report using the template from Minerva [under “Forms and Templates (staff)”]. Please try to give as much detail as you can under "Notes" as this will form the basis of the feedback to the student.</div>
<div></div>
<div>2. Save with a filename that makes it clear if this is the supervisor’s or assessor’s report. There is no need for a signature.</div>
<div></div>
<div>3. Go to the Minerva page for <span class="mark8lmlcci7d" data-markjs="true" data-ogac="" data-ogab="" data-ogsc="" data-ogsb="">COMP3931</span> Individual Project.</div>
<div></div>
<div>4. Go to “Grade Centre” -&gt; “Full Grade Centre”, and find the column for “Final Report” (you may need to expand the window or hide some other columns to see it).</div>
<div></div>
<div>5. There should be a yellow exclamation mark alongside the student. Click on the v-symbol to its right and select “Attempt ”.</div>
<div></div>
<div>6. Under “ Instructor Notes”, attach your file as a PDF.</div>
<div></div>
<div>IMPORTANT: If there are already files attached, ENSURE YOURS HAS A DIFFERENT NAME, otherwise the existing file will be silently overwritten.</div>
<div></div>
<div></div>
<div></div>
<div>After the meeting between the supervisor and assessor:</div>
<div></div>
<div>There are 3 possible outcomes:</div>
<div></div>
<div></div>
<div></div>
<div>1. Individual scores 10 marks apart or less; supervisor and assessor agree on a final mark.</div>
<div></div>
<div>a. Both prepare the Final Report using the template [Minerva -&gt; “Forms and Templates (staff)”]. Please try to include as much detail as possible from the "Notes" sections from both individual reports.</div>
<div></div>
<div>b. The supervisor should upload to Minerva and attach to the “ Feedback to User” section as a PDF.</div>
<div></div>
<div></div>
<div></div>
<div>2. Individual scores more than 10 apart; supervisor and assessor agree on a final mark.</div>
<div></div>
<div>a. Both prepare the final report.</div>
<div></div>
<div>b. The supervisor uploads to Minerva and attaches to the " Instructor Notes" section.</div>
<div></div>
<div>c. The supervisor also provides an explanation as to why it was possible to agree on a final score despite the initial difference. This can be as either a PDF attached under “ Instructor Notes”, or as plain text in the “ Notes” box.</div>
<div></div>
<div>(there may be a light third assessment depending on the explanation)</div>
<div></div>
<div></div>
<div></div>
<div>3. Supervisor and assessor cannot agree on a final mark.</div>
<div></div>
<div>a. The supervisor should provide an explanation as to why agreement was not possible, either as a PDF attached to “ Instructor Notes” or as plain text in the “ Notes” box.</div>
<div></div>
<div>(there will be a full, blind third assessment)</div>
<div></div>
<div></div>
<div></div>
<div>Whatever the outcome, please return the hard copies of the reports to the SSO.</div>
