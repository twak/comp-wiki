Dear Module Leader,

&nbsp;

Please check your module catalogue/s thoroughly and inform me of any changes for <strong>the 2020/21</strong> academic session by <strong>NO LATER THAN Monday 3<sup>rd</sup> February</strong><strong>.</strong>

This is to enable us to take all proposals to the next STSEC.

<strong> </strong>

<strong>IF YOU HAVE NO CHANGES, PLEASE ALSO LET CHARLOTTE KNOW BY THE DEADLINE.</strong>

&nbsp;

Please copy and paste from the catalogue onto Word and use ‘track changes’ or highlight changes in red and send to Charlotte Francis via email.

<a href="http://webprod3.leeds.ac.uk/catalogue/modulesearch.asp?L=UG&amp;Y=201920&amp;E=COMP&amp;N=all&amp;S=&amp;A=any">http://webprod3.leeds.ac.uk/catalogue/modulesearch.asp?L=UG&amp;Y=201920&amp;E=COMP&amp;N=all&amp;S=&amp;A=any</a> - UG modules

&nbsp;

<a href="http://webprod3.leeds.ac.uk/catalogue/modulesearch.asp?L=TP&amp;Y=201920&amp;E=COMP&amp;N=all&amp;S=&amp;A=any">http://webprod3.leeds.ac.uk/catalogue/modulesearch.asp?L=TP&amp;Y=201920&amp;E=COMP&amp;N=all&amp;S=&amp;A=any</a>   - PGT modules

&nbsp;

Charlotte will collate these and I will then check all these requests and if there are no concerns, these will go through STSEC approval in very early February.

Charlotte or I will let you know prior to that if there are concerns.

&nbsp;

If you make any changes in one area, please check that no wording elsewhere needs amending.  For example, sometimes, an assessment is removed and this assessment is mentioned elsewhere, such as in the syllabus, but this reference has not been removed.

<strong> </strong>

<strong>Pre-Requisites/ Mutually Exclusive Modules</strong>

&nbsp;

If either of these apply to your module, please check that the information is accurate.  If you think that there should be information here but currently there isn’t, please let me know and I will check with Roland.

&nbsp;

<strong> </strong>

<strong>Teaching Methods &amp; Assessment </strong>

&nbsp;

<strong>ALL timetabled sessions and assessments must be listed and accurate. </strong>

<strong>Please check exam format - Standard Exam = closed book.</strong>

&nbsp;

Please avoid grouping assessments, unless there is a reason behind this in the way that the percentages are worked out for example.  Each assessment should be listed separately where possible.  E.g.

&nbsp;

Avoid:

3 x report, 30%

&nbsp;

Instead:

Report 1, 10%

Report 2, 10%

Report 3, 10%

&nbsp;

Let me know if you have any questions. The attached form includes guidance on this process.
