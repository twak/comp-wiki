</p>

   <a href="https://leedsforlife.leeds.ac.uk/Tutor">Leeds for Life</a> <b>grade codes</b>
   <p>
      A common code at Level 3 is C, eg. 0C, where a student has not yet completed their project. C denotes they have an agreed extension.
   </p>
      <p>
In some cases students have Academic Integrity penalties that must be expunged. This is essential. Even if a student has passed 110/120 credits they must remove any Academic Integrity penalty before next year, during the resit period.
</p>
      <p>
You will know if they have a penalty if you see a grade of I/H/G against a module.
</p>
      <p>
         <ul>
<li>I = under investigation - please ask the SSO for the outcome if you see an I grade.       The student will not yet know an outcome.</li>
<li>H = a penalty is applied that must be removed by resit work in August.        The student will have been notified.</li>
<li>G = a penalty has been expunged and the grade applies. No further action.</li>
<li>WD = withdrawn (added by tom).</li>
<li>	0H = ??? (added by tom)</li>
   </ul>
</p>
      <p>
CS/Math students may see further codes U/V.
</p>
      <p>
         <ul>
<li>U =  under investigation - please ask the SSO for advice. The student will not yet know an outcome.</li>
<li>V = a component of work was compulsory to pass and has been failed. In most cases both coursework and exam must be passed to receive credit. The student should seek advice from Maths module leader. </li>
   </ul>
