List of <a href="https://leedsforlife.leeds.ac.uk/Tutor">tutees here</a>. A worse <a href="https://studentservices.leeds.ac.uk/">list</a> ('Faculty &amp; Student Information' --&gt; List of all tutored students and links to information). SIS used to have a list.

Different schools have different routines for tutorials. Computing always meets the whole group, relitively often. The frequency of meetings changes with the year of the students:
<ul>
 	<li>First years: once a week in first semester; once a fortnight in semester two.</li>
 	<li>Second years: twice a term</li>
 	<li>Third years &amp; MSc: ?once a term?</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
The groups are too big for the offices, so try to book a bigger room - every other member of staff will also try to book a bigger room at the same time.
</p>
<p>
These were meant to mirror Oxbridge's every-week tutorials-with-academic-content; however at Leeds there is no academic content. Our basic goal is to make friends with the students, so they have a friendly face to turn to if things go wrong (and hopefully you build enough of relationship that they come to you <em>before</em> things go wrong...).
</p>
<p>
You will meet your new tutees the week before semester one starts. The tstaff mailing list will send out a temporary page containing your tutees. I tend to play <a href="https://www.icebreakers.ws/medium-group/blanket-game.html">games</a> in these sessions. There might be a couple of meetings in the week, and a "party" in the refectory at the end.

Resources for tutorial sessions are scattered, incoherent, and scarce. Uni page <a href="https://ses.leeds.ac.uk/info/21800/student_support/836/personal_tutoring">here,</a> <a href="Personal-tutor-toolkit.pdf">tutor toolkit</a>, <a href="personal-tutor-toolkit.html">random email from FEPS</a> (which doesn't match with the meeting frequencies suggested in computing), <a href="https://vcg.leeds.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/How-to-be-an-effective-Academic-Personal-Tutor.pdf">general strategies</a> (computing doesn't do 1-1 meetings) and <a href="https://vcg.leeds.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Useful-referral-points-for-APT.pdf">referral points</a>. Some of my sessions:
<ul>
 	<li>every session: quickly go around everyone and answer: "one thing that's gone well, one that's gone badly, and what are you looking forward to". Good way to quickly gauge mood and have everybody say something.</li>
 	<li>introduce some of your research (communication challenge for you!)</li>
 	<li>public speaking (who can talk for 5 minutes with repeating, present a news article, module content, etc...)</li>
 	<li>debate. Break the group in two and have them prepare arguments for and against a particular point:

There is little incentive for the students to attend (marks or curriculum).  
   <ul>
      <li>best keep it fun.</li>
      <li>remind them that it'll be you writing references etc...</li>
      <li>email students who fail to attend is week asking "is everything okay?".</li>
      <li>Luckily there are also very few checks that tutorials take place or are well taught.</li>
   </ul>
