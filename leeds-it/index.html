<strong>IT Tickets.</strong> Make all requests <a href="http://it.leeds.ac.uk">here</a> or <a href="mailto:leeds@service-now.com">email</a>. Use this for everything from "install a font" to "my mouse is broken" to "install XXX in Dec10".  
<ul>
   <li>there is better interface to mange multiple requests <a href="https://it.leeds.ac.uk/home.do">here</a>.</li>
   <li>it has been suggested that calling IT often yields better results than their ticket system:  <a href="01133433333">)0113) 3433333</a></li>
   <li>my experiences have generally been negative. There is no priority for teaching requests ("Qt stopped linking in lab this week"), and they use the same staff for the school of computing and the rest of univesity. They were good at answering questions about ms office, less than good at getting visual studio running.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>

<strong>Admin</strong> permissions. It seems faculty are not expected to write code or install software frequently. 
<ul>
      <li>IT was apparently "centralised under <a href="https://thetab.com/uk/leeds/2016/05/04/new-head-resigned-former-banking-job-1bn-debt-crisis-24650"?Jim Slack</a>" and the School of Computing seems to have lost permissions over most of its own hardware at that point. The <a href="https://arc.leeds.ac.uk/">research computing</a> is supposed to fill this gap.</li>
      <li>During my first 2 years at leeds there was a whole year where I didn't have access to my PC or I didn't have admin. Some of this was covid, but mostly because the IT support was geared toward non-technical staff.</li>
      <li>Task like "i need to compile this C++ and Qt code on my laptop because you're flying me to teach in UI in Chengdu next week"...were only solved weeks after teaching had finished. I had to use/expose my own hardware to China to run the module.</li>
      <li>My PhD student didn't get admin on his local ML box for his entire PhD. Despite face-to-face meetings with all levels of IT and the HoS. He was told "to use containers instead".</li>
      <li>As I was leaving Leeds there were claims these problems had been solved after <a href="https://it.leeds.ac.uk/it?id=kb_article&sysparm_article=KB0016267">"consulation with exteral consultants"</a>. Doesn't seem to include linux.</li>
      <li>These issues were raised at staff meetings, we agreed a senior prof would send a letter of complaint in about 2019...but things went silent after the professor had their particular problems solved.</li>
      <li>When I wrote a <a href="redacted_by_it">tounge-in-cheek version of this wiki</a> on the group's site, I was booked into a 1:1 with the research computing's "IT Business Relationship Manager" who had me remove critiscim of their services.</li>

<strong>IT Service Desk.</strong> On level 10 in EC Stoner.

   <strong>Website</strong>. Edit your university (Jadu) webpage <a href="https://production2.leeds.ac.uk/eps/jadu/login?destination=%2Feps%2Fjadu%2Fcustom%2Fedit_my_staff_details.php">here</a>. It will be listed publicly <a href="https://eps.leeds.ac.uk/computing/stafflist">here</a>. It finds publications from Symplectic automatically. To advertise PhD projects on the<a href="https://phd.leeds.ac.uk/"> university's portal</a>, use <a href="https://production2.leeds.ac.uk/phd/jadu">this</a>. There is no way to list only your PhD projects... Both these system have a delay while marketing checks your content before uploading. Other Schools seeem to have <a href="http://homepages.see.leeds.ac.uk/~lecjm/">their</a> <a href="http://homepages.see.leeds.ac.uk/~mm16jdc">own</a> webpages (SoComputing lost the fight with IT on this one...).

<p>
   <strong>Group websites.</strong> Sites like <a href="vcg.leeds.ac.uk">vcg</a> are run by research groups. They are wordpress installs on <a href="https://wpengine.co.uk/">WPE</a>. They all use the uni's <a href="https://whs.leeds.ac.uk/user-guide/">theme</a>. Apply <a href="https://whs.leeds.ac.uk/">here</a>. IT charges the school £500 a year for the privilege of running your own WP plugins.

<strong>Dec10</strong>. The School's Linux lab on lvl 10 EC Stoner. (named after the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PDP-10">PDP-10</a> terminal in the room). The air conditioning is controlled from the locked office so the room is usually too hot/cold. If your lab is scheduled, you can ask everyone else to leave.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Faculty Linux Computers</strong>. You can get an online clone of the Dec10 environment on <a href="https://feng-linux.leeds.ac.uk/">feng</a> (<a href="http://feng-gps.leeds.ac.uk">alternative</a>. Both require VPN). It is also possible to shell into any of the Dec10 machines. They use the module system to access installed software ("module avail" at the command line). I have found a few cases where feng wasn't able to run code which does run in Dec10.

<strong>2FA</strong>In 2021 Leeds introduced <a href="https://it.leeds.ac.uk/it/softcentre?id=kb_article_view&sys_kb_id=f919ec661b02e8102224eca13d4bcbca">Duo</a> for 2FA. Required for VPN + most microsoft services. You are expected to run this on your personal phone hardware.

<strong>Internet</strong>. Generally less than 100Mbs. Leeds uni IP block seems to be <em>129.11.0.0/16</em>.

<p>
<strong>Remote access.</strong>
<ul>
 	<li>Your desktop machine will have a <a href="http://mypc.leeds.ac.uk/">static ip</a>.</li>
 	<li>Shell in from outside campus using <em>ssh scsxxx@remote-access.leeds.ac.uk  </em>You can then shell into most local machines. Duo required.</li>
 	<li>Tony recommends: <a href="https://mobaxterm.mobatek.net/">https://mobaxterm.mobatek.net/</a></li>
 	<li>VPN info (<a href="https://leeds.service-now.com/it?id=kb_article&amp;sysparm_article=KB0011026">win</a>, <a href="https://leeds.service-now.com/it?id=kb_article&amp;sysparm_article=KB0010377">osx</a>, linux info missing). Some services won't work over VPN (<a href="https://sis.engineering.leeds.ac.uk/">SIS</a>: yes; <a href="https://selfservice.mais.leeds.ac.uk:444/irj/portal">Mais</a>: no)</li>
   <li>On windows I use a saved Putty profile (with <a href="https://devops.ionos.com/tutorials/use-ssh-keys-with-putty-on-windows/">key on server</a>) and have a second browser <a href="https://linuxize.com/post/how-to-setup-ssh-socks-tunnel-for-private-browsing/">SOCKS tunnel</a> through</li>.
