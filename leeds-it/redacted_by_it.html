<p><strong>IT Tickets.</strong> Make all requests <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201007152635/http://it.leeds.ac.uk/">here</a> or <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201007152635/mailto:leeds@service-now.com">email</a>. Use this for everything from “install a font” to “my mouse is broken” to “install XXX in Dec10”. You will need lots of requests to get anything done. There is better interface to mange multiple requests <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201007152635/https://it.leeds.ac.uk/home.do">here</a>.</p>
<p><strong>IT Service Desk.</strong> On level 10 in EC Stoner (up staircase 2, turn left, room has a big glass front). You can wait in line to have someone tell&nbsp; you they can’t fix your problem.</p>
<p><strong>Uptime</strong>. See what is broken today <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201007152635/https://it.leeds.ac.uk/it?id=services_status">here</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Website</strong>. Edit your university (Jadu) webpage <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201007152635/https://production2.leeds.ac.uk/eps/jadu/login?destination=%2Feps%2Fjadu%2Fcustom%2Fedit_my_staff_details.php">here</a>. It will be listed publicly <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201007152635/https://eps.leeds.ac.uk/computing/stafflist">here</a>. It finds publications from Symplectic automatically. To advertise PhD projects on the<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201007152635/https://phd.leeds.ac.uk/"> university’s portal</a>, use <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201007152635/https://production2.leeds.ac.uk/phd/jadu">this</a>. There is no way to list only your PhD projects… Both these system have a delay while marketing checks your content before uploading.</p>
<p><strong>Group websites.</strong> Sites like this (vcg.leeds.ac.uk) are run by research groups. They are wordpress installs on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201007152635/https://wpengine.co.uk/">WPE</a>. They all use the uni’s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201007152635/https://whs.leeds.ac.uk/user-guide/">theme</a>. Apply <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201007152635/https://whs.leeds.ac.uk/">here</a>. VCG pays about £500 per year for the privilege of 3Gb storage and being able to write our own plugins (one of tom’s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201007152635/https://github.com/twak/leeds-wp-projects">plugins</a>). This is the only “free” web presence we are allowed – “so that marketing can always edit your content for compliance”.</p>
<p><strong>Dec10</strong>. The School’s Linux lab on lvl 10 EC Stoner. (named after the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201007152635/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PDP-10">PDP-10</a> terminal in the room) The air conditioning is controlled from the locked office so the room is usually too hot/cold/smells of cheese. If your lab is scheduled, you can ask everyone else to leave.</p>
<p><strong>Faculty Linux Computers</strong>. You can get an online clone of the Dec10 environmnet on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201007152635/https://feng-linux.leeds.ac.uk/">feng</a> (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201007152635/http://feng-gps.leeds.ac.uk/">alternative</a>. Both require VPN?!). It is also possible to shell into any of the Dec10 machines. They use the module system to access installed software (“module avail” at the command line).</p>
<p><strong>Admin.</strong> At Leeds most staff don’t get admin permissions. Every piece of software or font must be <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201007152635/https://it.leeds.ac.uk/it">requested</a> from IT. This usually takes 2 weeks. This makes doing computing research impractical (to say the least). To get admin permissions, follow these <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201007152635/https://it.leeds.ac.uk/it?id=kb_article&amp;sysparm_article=KB0013015">instructions,</a> it will help to get the form signed by Andy. This is the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201007152635/https://vcg.leeds.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/2018-10-29-150736.pdf">one</a> I submitted. “IT is too slow to install software” won’t work, try “I need nvidia-docker”. They will fight you, will probably ask for an in-person interview – be prepared to be difficult. They might threaten to remove network access – they do have a network they can give you access to if you make enough noise (network will be wired, but won’t be “internal”). IT will give you bios level access if you make enough of a fuss.</p>
<p><strong>Internet</strong>. Generally less than 100Mbs.</p>
<p><strong>Remote access.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Your desktop machine will have a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201007152635/http://mypc.leeds.ac.uk/">static ip</a>.</li>
<li>Leeds uni IP block seems to be <em>129.11.0.0/16.</em></li>
<li>Shell in from outside campus using <em>ssh scsxxx@remote-access.leeds.ac.uk&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>You can then shell into most local machines.</li>
