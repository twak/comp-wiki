School of computing <a href="https://leeds365.sharepoint.com/sites/SchoolOfComputing/SitePages/Home.aspx">sharepoint site</a> has <strong>staff contact info</strong> and <strong>staff meeting</strong> minutes.
 </p>

 <p>
<strong>Offices</strong>. E.C. Stoner is often too hot or too cold. The heating goes off at 5pm and isn't on over holidays/weekends. The school will buy heaters and fans if you ask. If you ask nicely they will buy large heaters.
</p>
 
 <p>
<strong>Cleaning</strong>. You have to send an email to <a href="mailto:D.Abel@leeds.ac.uk">Dawn</a> to have someone vacuum your office. Windows are cleaned once a year or so. Otherwise it seems it is our problem (if anyone knows where the school keeps its cleaning supplies, please let me know).
</p>

<p>
<strong>Keys</strong>. If you are faculty, the black key-fob-with-a-button will open most other labs, faculty offices, and meeting rooms. Hold it about 15cm in front of the lock and press the button. repeat. The level 6 and 10 doors are locked (and can't be opened from outside with your fob) at about 5.30pm.

<a>
<strong>Holidays. </strong>The uni is closed (EC Stoner was locked) for all UK bank holidays (often with an extra day), plus Christmas, New Year, and Easter (each usually with an extra few days to a week). <a href="https://www.leeds.ac.uk/secretariat/almanac.html">Uni calendar</a>. In addition to these you can take your holiday allowance (5 weeks). 
   
<p>
<strong>Time off.</strong> Book on <a href="https://selfservice.mais.leeds.ac.uk:444/irj/portal">mais</a>, if things get complicated (time off in leiu etc.., <a href="mailto:comp-away@leeds.ac.uk">email</a> here). Your allocation of holiday resets on 1st October - <a href="http://hr.leeds.ac.uk/info/36/leave_annual_leave_and_bank_holidays/21/academic_and_academic_related_professional_and_managerial_staff_annual_leave_entitlement">uni rules</a>. If you want long holidays - consider that there will still be MSc students to supervise over the Summer (but if you can do one meeting a week+emails while off the it'll be okay). Easter break is a good time to escape (students are still between taught between the other terms).
</p>

<p>
<strong>Maps.</strong> There is no known map of EC Stoner. (We once lost a junior faculty member for <em>weeks</em>...). <a href="https://www.leeds.ac.uk/campusmap">shitty University map</a>. Interior map of <a href="https://use.mazemap.com/#v=1&amp;zlevel=9&amp;center=-1.554995,53.805962&amp;zoom=17.3&amp;campusid=215&amp;sharepoitype=point&amp;sharepoi=-1.55764%2C53.80536">three buildings</a> (note the floor selector on left).
</p>

<p>
<strong>Coffee</strong>. There are kitchens on on floors 6,7, and 9. The social areas are the chairs behind the front desk on level 7, level 9 long room, and level 9 - these are open to students so don't discuss how ugly the students are. You should give Â£20 to Katherine every year for coffee club. There is no staff room.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Printing</strong>. From a PC you send things to <em>LeedsPrint</em>, then go to a printer and log-in to print. You can mange your queue on the <a href="https://papercut.leeds.ac.uk/">papercut</a> website. If you register your ID card with a printer it avoids entering your password every time. You paper usage is logged. The printers will scan to PDF and email the result to you. There is a printer (with a document tray) next the front desk on level 7.

   <ul>
      <li><a href="mailto:scshos@leeds.ac.uk">scshos@leeds.ac.uk</a> (note: broken?!) for Head of School enquiries (meeting requests, expense approvals, etc) then you should email SCS_Head of  and Jo will action your request.</li>

<p>
<strong>Buying things.</strong> If you want small things (headphones, webcams, books) ask Gaynor. Information on <a href="http://www.leeds.ac.uk/finance/e-expenses/e-expenses/e-expenses/e-expenses_staff_5_.html">Expenses</a> (e.g., travelling etc...). All travel goes through the <del>universally hated</del> much loved <a href="http://www.keytravel.com/">Key Travel</a>. If you want to spend money on other things you will need to go through one of the <a href="http://purchasing.leeds.ac.uk/site/index.php">purchasing</a> systems.
</p>

<p>
They run a course you have to go to before you can buy anything yourself - this gives you access to <a href="https://uolr3.leeds.ac.uk/sipr">SIPR</a> so you can raise a ticket to have purchasing buy something for you.

      <ul>
          <li>HR took 6 months to process my paperwork at the end of my probation (during which house prices rose 6%). </li>
          <li>when you finish probation your notice period for quitting drops from 1mo to 6mo. I never signed any end-of-probation paperwork and still had to work the 6mo...at some poorly defined point between when I submitted the paperwork and was sent a letter to sign saying I accept (which I didn't). The union said that this was normal.</li>
      </ul>
