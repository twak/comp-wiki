School of computing <a href="https://leeds365.sharepoint.com/sites/SchoolOfComputing/SitePages/Home.aspx">sharepoint site</a> has <strong>staff contact info</strong> and <strong>staff meeting</strong> minutes.
 </p>

 <p>
<strong>Offices</strong>. E.C. Stoner is often too hot or too cold. The heating goes off at 5pm and isn't on over holidays/weekends. The school will buy heaters and fans if you ask. If you ask nicely they will buy large heaters.
</p>
 
 <p>
<strong>Cleaning</strong>. You have to send an email to <a href="mailto:D.Abel@leeds.ac.uk">Dawn</a> to have someone vacuum your office. Windows are cleaned once a year or so. Otherwise it seems it is our problem (if anyone knows where the school keeps its cleaning supplies, please let me know).
</p>

<p>
<strong>Keys</strong>. If you are faculty, the black key-fob-with-a-button will open most other labs, faculty offices, and meeting rooms. Hold it about 15cm in front of the lock and press the button. repeat. The level 6 and 10 doors are locked (and can't be opened from outside with your fob) at about 5.30pm.

</p>

<p>
<strong>Holidays.</strong> Book on <a href="https://selfservice.mais.leeds.ac.uk:444/irj/portal">mais</a>, if things get complicated (time off in leiu etc.., <a href="mailto:comp-away@leeds.ac.uk">email</a> here). Your allocation of holiday resets on 1st October - <a href="http://hr.leeds.ac.uk/info/36/leave_annual_leave_and_bank_holidays/21/academic_and_academic_related_professional_and_managerial_staff_annual_leave_entitlement">uni rules</a>. If you want long holidays - consider that there will still be MSc students to supervise over the Summer. Easter break is a good time to escape (students are still between taught terms).
</p>

<p>
<strong>Maps.</strong> There is no known map of EC Stoner. (We once lost a junior faculty member for <em>weeks</em>...). <a href="https://www.leeds.ac.uk/campusmap">Shitty University map</a>. Interior map of <a href="https://use.mazemap.com/#v=1&amp;zlevel=9&amp;center=-1.554995,53.805962&amp;zoom=17.3&amp;campusid=215&amp;sharepoitype=point&amp;sharepoi=-1.55764%2C53.80536">three buildings</a> (note the floor selector on left).
</p>

<p>
<strong>Coffee</strong>. There are kitchens on on floors 6,7, and 9. The social areas are the chairs behind the front desk on level 7, level 9 long room, and level 9 - these are open to students so don't discuss how ugly the students are. You should give Â£20 to Katherine every year for coffee club. There is no staff room.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Printing</strong>. From a PC you send things to <em>LeedsPrint</em>, then go to a printer and log-in to print. You can mange your queue on the <a href="https://papercut.leeds.ac.uk/">papercut</a> website. If you register your ID card with a printer it avoids entering your password every time. You paper usage is logged. The printers will scan to PDF and email the result to you. There is a printer (with a document tray) next the front desk on level 7.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Room bookings</strong>. Email Katherine Garnett remembering to say how many people you the room for.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Stationary</strong>. The sliding-door cupboard in the common space on level 7 contains lots of stationary - if it is locked, ask the front desk or pick the lock.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Buying things.</strong> If you want small things (headphones, webcams, books) ask Gaynor. Information on <a href="http://www.leeds.ac.uk/finance/e-expenses/e-expenses/e-expenses/e-expenses_staff_5_.html">Expenses</a> (e.g., travelling etc...). All travel goes through the <del>universally hated</del> much loved <a href="http://www.keytravel.com/">Key Travel</a>. If you want to spend money on other things you will need to go through one of the <a href="http://purchasing.leeds.ac.uk/site/index.php">purchasing</a> systems.
</p>

<p>
They run a course you have to go to before you can buy anything yourself - this gives you access to <a href="https://uolr3.leeds.ac.uk/sipr">SIPR</a> so you can raise a ticket to have purchasing buy something for you.
